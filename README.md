# Brazilian_E-Commerce_Analytics_Project
End-to-end e-commerce analytics project analyzing delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and revenue risk using Python, SQL, statistical modeling, and Power BI.

## Business Problem
Often times e-commerce companies face customer churn driven by delayed deliveries. This project analyzes how delivery performance impacts customer satisfaction and revenue risk. 
### Project Goal: How do delivery performance and order characteristics affect customer satisfaction?
In order ot get customer feedback, e-commerce companies usually let customers write a review and leave a score of their order experiance. The review score can then effortlessly be used as a way to measure customer satisfaction. 
A few questions were created in order to achive our goal and be more focus on the type of data needed to be analyze. The main qustion was: **Do delivery delays lead to lower customer review scores?**. To help support and answer this question, 
3 more questions were made.
1. Are late deliveries statistically associated with worse reviews?
2. What factors predict long delivery times?
3. Do higher-priced orders get better reviews? 

It is important to keep customers satisfy so that they return and buy from the site, but aslo spend larger amounts in order for revenue to increase. Sellers also need to be content so they too will keep on using
the site to sell their products and keep the businiess operating. Analyzing the data is a critical part in solving these issues.
